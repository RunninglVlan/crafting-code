# Crafting Code

This project is for practicing Kotlin (as well as its Gradle DSL) and TDD using Katas.

I started learning Kotlin using its [Koans](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/tutorials/koans.html) shortly before I went to one-day Crafting Code Workshop led by [Sandro Mancuso](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso). Workshop was about TDD and writing well-crafted code.

During the day I learned about TDD Katas - exercises in coding, refactoring and test-first programming. We worked in pairs on arabic to roman numerals converter, which I finally finished at home.

As I am not that experienced with TDD and like its idea as well as doing coding exercises, I decided to hone my skills doing different Katas, as well as learning Kotlin. That's how this repository appeared.

Tests are written in Spock as I like it for its simplicity.
